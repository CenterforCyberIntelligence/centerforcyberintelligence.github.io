  <h2>Advancing Cyber Intelligence Standards for a Secure Future</h2>

  <p>The Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) is an open community dedicated to defining and advancing cyber intelligence as a discipline. Since our founding in 2019, we have focused on developing industry standards, sharing best practices, and empowering large and small organizations to integrate intelligence-driven security into their operations.</p>

## Our Mission

CCI exists to develop and provide best-in-class cyber intelligence standards, frameworks, and guidance, fostering an environment that promotes visibility, innovation, and the evolution of the cyber intelligence industry.

## What We Do

Intelligence as a practice has been fundamental to growing nations and governments for hundreds of years. has long been a function within government, but effective adoption in the private sector remains a significant challenge. Many organizations seek to establish intelligence-driven security practices to better defend against emerging cyber threats but lack the skills or knowledge to effectively operationalize their vision. To address this need, we have embarked on several missions, one of which is the **Cyber Intelligence Framework (CIF)**—a living, collaborative standard that helps organizations implement effective cyber intelligence strategies at the **tactical, operational, and strategic** levels.

Through an open-source, community-driven approach, we aim to become the **"NIST of Cyber Intelligence"**—a trusted authority that organizations can rely on when developing their cyber intelligence programs.

## Our Activities

In addition to framework development, CCI:

* **Provides Expert Guidance** – Offering cybersecurity and cyber intelligence consultation tailored to diverse organizational needs, from startups to enterprises.

* **Fosters Collaboration** – Engaging with cybersecurity professionals, intelligence analysts, and small business leaders to share knowledge, strategies, and best practices.

* **Supports Open-Source Initiatives** – Publishing free or low-cost resources, tools, and documentation to promote the evolution of the cyber intelligence community.

## A Vendor-Agnostic, Community-Driven Approach

Unlike traditional cybersecurity vendors, CCI operates independently of commercial pressures. This allows us to provide unbiased, practical, cost-effective solutions that benefit organizations. We remain committed to **open collaboration, transparency, and accessibility**—ensuring that the cyber intelligence field continues to mature through shared expertise and innovation.

Join us as we work toward a future where cyber intelligence is not just a government function but a **standardized, accessible, and indispensable** part of every organization's security strategy.
