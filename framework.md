# Cyber Intelligence Framework

## A Comprehensive Approach to Modern Cyber Intelligence

The Cyber Intelligence Framework (CIF) provides organizations with a structured approach to implementing effective cyber intelligence capabilities that align with their security goals and business objectives.

## Framework Levels

### Strategic Level

Long-term intelligence focusing on organizational risks, threat landscapes, and future planning. Informs executive decision-making and security strategy.

### Operational Level

Mid-term intelligence that supports campaign planning, resource allocation, and cross-functional coordination to address known and emerging threats.

### Tactical Level

Short-term, technical intelligence that enables immediate action by security operations teams to detect, prevent, and respond to active threats.

## Core Components

The framework addresses five critical domains of cyber intelligence:

1. **Collection** - Methods and sources for gathering relevant intelligence data
2. **Processing** - Techniques for transforming raw data into usable formats
3. **Analysis** - Approaches for deriving insights and meaning from processed data
4. **Dissemination** - Systems for effectively sharing intelligence with stakeholders
5. **Feedback** - Processes for continuous improvement and refinement

## Implementation Guidance

Organizations can implement the framework using a phased approach:

1. **Assessment** - Evaluate current intelligence capabilities and identify gaps
2. **Planning** - Develop a roadmap for implementing or enhancing intelligence functions
3. **Building** - Establish processes, technologies, and teams aligned with framework components
4. **Integration** - Connect intelligence outputs to security operations and business functions
5. **Maturation** - Continuously enhance capabilities through measurement and refinement
