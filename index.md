## The Cyber Intelligence Framework (CIF)

Cyber intelligence has evolved beyond government applications to become essential for private sector security. Our flagship initiative, the **Cyber Intelligence Framework (CIF)**, provides organizations with a structured approach to implementing effective intelligence capabilities across three critical levels:

<div class="framework-levels">
  <div class="level strategic">Strategic Intelligence: Long-term planning and executive decision-making</div>
  <div class="level operational">Operational Intelligence: Threat monitoring and security posture management</div>
  <div class="level tactical">Tactical Intelligence: Day-to-day threat detection and response</div>
</div>

## A Vendor-Agnostic Community Approach

Unlike traditional cybersecurity vendors, CCI operates independently of commercial pressures. Our commitment to **open collaboration, transparency, and accessibility** ensures that organizations of all sizes can benefit from intelligence-driven security practices.
