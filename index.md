# Center for Cyber Intelligence

## Advancing Cyber Intelligence Standards for a Secure Future

The Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) is an open community dedicated to defining and advancing cyber intelligence as a discipline. Since our founding in 2019, we have focused on developing industry standards, sharing best practices, and empowering organizations of all sizes to integrate intelligence-driven security into their operations.

## The Cyber Intelligence Framework (CIF)

Cyber intelligence has evolved beyond government applications to become essential for private sector security. Our flagship initiative, the **Cyber Intelligence Framework (CIF)**, provides organizations with a structured approach to implementing effective intelligence capabilities across three critical levels:

- **Strategic Intelligence**: Long-term planning and executive decision-making
- **Operational Intelligence**: Threat monitoring and security posture management
- **Tactical Intelligence**: Day-to-day threat detection and response

## A Vendor-Agnostic Community Approach

Unlike traditional cybersecurity vendors, CCI operates independently of commercial pressures. Our commitment to **open collaboration, transparency, and accessibility** ensures that organizations of all sizes can benefit from intelligence-driven security practices.
